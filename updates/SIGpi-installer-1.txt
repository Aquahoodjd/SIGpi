Welcome to SIGpi-installer

Given a Raspberry Pi4 with 4GB RAM, a 32GB microSD with Raspberry Pi OS Full (32-bit) installed, 
this script installs drivers and applications for signals intelligence (SIGINT) and Amateur Radio use.

Installation will continue with the following steps:

- Choose SDR devices
- Select GNUradio version
- Choose SDR applications
- Choose Amateur Radio applications
- Choose Additional Tools

This installation can take three hours to install with almost half that time spent compiling/building
GNuradio and SDRangel.

Let's begin.
