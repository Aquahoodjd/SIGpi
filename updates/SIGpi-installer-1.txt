Welcome to SIGpi-installer

Given a Raspberry Pi4 with 4GB RAM, a 32GB microSD with Raspberry Pi OS Full (32-bit) installed, 
this script installs drivers and applications for signals intelligence (SIGINT) and Amateur Radio use.

Installation will continue with the following steps:

- Choose Devices
- Select GNUradio version
- Select Digital Decoders
- Choose SDR applications
- Choose Amateur Radio Library and Applications
- Choose Packet Radio Applications
- Choose Additional Tools

This installation can take more than three hours to install with almost half that time spent compiling/building
GNuradio and SDRangel.

Let's begin.
